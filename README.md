Here's a shell script (`install_vscode.sh`) that automates the installation of VSCode on Ubuntu using the APT method (recommended for updates).

I've created a shell script named `install_vscode.sh` to automate the installation of VSCode on Ubuntu. You can save and run it with:

```bash
chmod +x install_vscode.sh
./install_vscode.sh
```
